"""A helper class to manage a connection to a dm_env_rpc server.

This helper class allows sending the Request message types and receiving the
Response message types without wrapping in an EnvironmentRequest or unwrapping
from an EnvironmentResponse.  It also turns error messages in to exceptions.

For most calls (such as create, join, etc.):

    with connection.Connection(grpc_channel) as channel:
      create_response = channel.send(dm_env_rpc_pb2.CreateRequest(settings={
        'players': 5
      })

For the `extension` message type, you must send an Any proto and you'll get back
an Any proto.  It is up to you to wrap and unwrap these to concrete proto types
that you know how to handle.

    with connection.Connection(grpc_channel) as channel:
      request = struct_pb2.Struct()
      ...
      request_any = any_pb2.Any()
      request_any.Pack(request)
      response_any = channel.send(request_any)
      response = my_type_pb2.MyType()
      response_any.Unpack(response)


Any errors encountered in the EnvironmentResponse are turned into Python
exceptions, so explicit error handling code isn't needed per call.
